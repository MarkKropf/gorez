<p>
As a member of the Pivotal product management org, I led engineering teams that are hyper-focused
on modern software dev methodology - TDD, paired programming, agile/lean/XP principles and
practices. I also served a complex set of stakeholders: an established open-source community, a
nascent account team and a small but demanding set of enterprise-level customers during a 2-year
period where Pivotal revenue from Cloud Foundry went from $0 to $125MM TCV/yr.

Cloud Foundry CLI PM - led a small agile engineering team developing the CF command line
toolset. (github.com/cloudfoundry/cli). Took on this lesser (than BOSH PM) role to free up
time and resources to begin engaging in deep feedback cycles with key customers - work that
would become my next role.
