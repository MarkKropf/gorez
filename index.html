Sr. Product Manager - Cloud Foundry 1/14 - 10/15
•
•
As a member of the Pivotal product management org, I led engineering teams that are hyper-focused
on modern software dev methodology - TDD, paired programming, agile/lean/XP principles and
practices. I also served a complex set of stakeholders: an established open-source community, a
nascent account team and a small but demanding set of enterprise-level customers during a 2-year
period where Pivotal revenue from Cloud Foundry went from $0 to $125MM TCV/yr.
Cloud Foundry CLI PM - led a small agile engineering team developing the CF command line
toolset. (github.com/cloudfoundry/cli). Took on this lesser (than BOSH PM) role to free up
time and resources to begin engaging in deep feedback cycles with key customers - work that
would become my next role.
BOSH PM - led an agile engineering team developing BOSH
(github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh). Responsible for BOSH CPI, agents, release and all
components of the BOSH product suite.
